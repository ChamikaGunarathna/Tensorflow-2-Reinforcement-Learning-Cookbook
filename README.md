# TensorFlow 2 Reinforcement Learning Cookbook

## About the TFRL Cookbook

The TFRL Cookbook provides recipes for you to:
| |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Build**: Deep RL agents from scratch using the all-new and powerful TensorFlow 2.x framework and Keras API |
| **Implement**: Deep RL algorithms (DQN, A3C, DDPG, PPO, SAC etc.) with minimal lines of code |
| **Train**: Deep RL agents in simulated environments (gyms) beyond toy-problems and games to perform real-world tasks like cryptocurrency trading, stock trading, tweet/email management and more! |
| **Scale**: Distributed training of RL agents using TensorFlow 2.x, Ray + Tune + RLLib |
| **Deploy**: RL agents to the cloud and edge for real-world testing by creating cloud services, web apps and Android mobile apps using TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow.js, ONNX and Triton |

## Getting started

1. Install system dependencies:`sudo apt install -y make cmake ffmpeg`
2. Install miniconda: `wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh && bash -b -p ${HOME}/miniconda3`
3. Setup conda python virtual environment: `bash && conda env create -f tfrl-cookbook.yml -n "tfrl-cookbook"`
   You are all set!

4. Activate the `tfrl-cookbook` conda python environment: `conda activate tfrl-cookbook` and get started with the recipes in the book!
