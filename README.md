| :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Build**: Deep RL agents from scratch using the all-new and powerful TF 2.x  and  Keras API |
| **Implement State-of-the-art**: Deep RL algorithms (DQN, A3C, DDPG, PPO, SAC etc.) with minimal lines of code |
| **Train**: Deep RL agents in simulated environments (gyms) {beyond games} to perform real-world tasks like cryptocurrency & stock trading, automatic and To-Do task completing bots |
| **Scale**: Distributed training of RL agents using TFx 2.x   |
| **Deploy**: RL agents to the cloud and edge for real-world testing by creating desktop apps, cloud services, web apps and IOS/Android mobile apps using TensorFlow 2.x |

#### Setup instructions
1. Install system dependencies:`sudo apt install -y make cmake ffmpeg`
2. Install miniconda: `wget  https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh && bash -b -p ${HOME}/miniconda3`
3. Setup conda python virtual environment: `bash && conda env create -f tfrl-cookbook.yml -n "tfrl-cookbook"`
You are all set!

4. Activate the `tfrl-cookbook` conda python environment: `conda activate tfrl-cookbook` and get started with the recipes in the book!
